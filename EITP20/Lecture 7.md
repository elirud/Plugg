* __What is the purpose with a security review and when should it be performed?__
* __At which four main levels do you typically perform a security evaluation?__
    * __At which occasion should they be done?__
* __Mention three different aspects to consider at an architecture "sanity check" review__
    * __For each aspect, list what should be considered?__
* __Mention three different aspects to consider at an architecture business review__
    * __For each aspect, list what should be considered?__
* __What do you perform during a security requirements review?__
* __Mention four different aspects to consider at a design review__
    * __For each aspect, list what should be considered?__
* __Describe a process for issuing and security testing of a software product__
    * __What is the role in the process for the security officer, the security architect, the security master and security penetration tester respectively?__
* __Give examples of things to consider during a performance review of a design?__
* __What is the purpose of trying to "measure" the security of a design?__
* __A simple security measurement takes three basic security characteristics into account:__
    * __Which three characteristics are then measured and how to you combine the measurements to get an overall measurement of a system?__
* __Consider the smart card security system below. Assume the side-channel and physical channel break are equal important and the overall smart card security is the minmum * strength of the two nodes. Calculate the smart card security score using the weighted weakest link approach.__
* __How can the sensitivity for a certain security component be calculated?__
* __What is a CVE database? Which organizations maintain global CVEs?__
* __Which are the tree basic categories for which CVE scoring is based__
    * __Briefly explain each of the three categories and which security aspects are considered for each of them?__
* __A communication product have three different categories of weaknesses, buffer overflow, TPM weaknesses, and authentication weakness with the CVE list below. Calculate an * overall vulnerability score for the product (use the NIST CVE database to obtain the individual scores).__
    * __Buffer overflow: CVE-2019-2304, CVE-2019-2242, CVE-2019-10572__
    * __TPM: CVE-2019-16863, CVE-2018-6622__
