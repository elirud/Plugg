## Lecture 1
* __Which are the steps involved in the overall design process of a secure system?__
    1. Define use case (stakeholder)
    2. Describe system (stakeholder)
    2. System expectation (stakeholder)
    2. Threat analysis
    3. Security requirements
    4. Security architecture
    5. System design
    6. System evaluation
* __Describe the relationship between the different steps?__
    Pretty self explanatory
* __In which way do a use-case description assist in the secure system design process?__
    If another person wrote the use case, it might give some insight that would otherwise be missed.
* ___What is a threat analysis?__
    An analysis of the possible threats.
* __What is the main purpose of performing a threat analysis?__
    To get a grasp on when your system might be vulrenable to, and help you design it accordinly in later stages.
* __Can you give example of threat analysis approaches?__
    1. Attack tree.
    2. Vulnerability sources.
    3. Vulnerability terminology sources (MITRE).
* __What is the purpose of a security requirements list?__
    A security requirement list will list the security requirement you got from working on your result of the threat analysis.
    It will then help you see what your design will need, as you will design and evaluate against these requirements.
* __Can you list input sources for deriving security requirements?__
    1. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
    2. NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
    3. BlackHat and SchooCon presentations
* __Which are the duties of the security engineering in the security requirements gathering process?__
    Propose the threats to build the requirements from. Analyze proposed requirements and break them down 
    according to the use case and system needs given from stakeholder.
* __Can you elaborate on the main differences between security requirements and other system requirements?__
    1. Security requirement can be a micture of functional and on-functional requirements, that can be hard to *verfiy* that they are fulfilled.
    2. It might have more to do with how the system is used and handled more than properties of the system itself.
    3. Might need continued and complementing updates of the requirements.
* __Please list at least three different “types” of security architectures?__
    1. Logical
    2. Physical
    3. Component
    4. Conceptual
    1. Contextual
* __Explain the main differences between the different listed types?__
* __Which are the main steps preceeding the actual security design step?__
    1. Define use case (stakeholder)
    2. Describe system (stakeholder)
    2. Threat analysis
    3. Security requirements
    4. Security architecture
* __Explain the main design choices that need to be done at the security design process.__
* __List and explain different type of security evaluations that typically are done ”in house”__
* __List and explain different type of security evaluations that typically are done by external experts__
    1. Pen test.
* __What is a pen test and what is the purpose of such test?__
    A pen test is basically trying to break your own system in order to find potential vulnerabilities.
* __What is a protocol analysis tool and what is the purpose of using such tool?__
    A protocol analysis tool is something that you can use to describe your protocol, and it will then find errors or potential vulnerabilities.
* __What is the Common Criteria (CC) standard?__
    The common criteria standard is an evaluation standard used to define how secure a system is using different levels of evaluation.
* __List the 7 evaluation levels defined in CC and explain the main differences between the levels?__
    1. Functionally tested
    2. Structurally tested
    3. Methodically tested and checked
    4. Methodically designed, tested and reviewed
    5. Semi-formally designed and tested
    6. Semi-formally verified design and tested
    7. Formally verified design and tested 
* __List the three different system documents part of a CC and describe their main purpose.__
* __What is CISSP?__
    CISSP: Certified Information Systems Security Professional.
    A certificate to show your knowledge in security, can then branch into different areas.
