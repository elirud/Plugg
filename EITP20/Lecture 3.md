* **Describe what constitutes a security architecture and give some examples.**
* **The Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture (SABSA) consist of 5 layers and one cross layer.**
    * **Describe the different layer views and list the names of the different layers.**
    * **Give examples of questions the different SABSA architecture views are supposed to answer**
* **Which are the three different types of security services in a logical security architecture?**
    * **List and explain examples of services part of the non-prevention type of security services.**
* **Describe each of the different prevention security services in more details.**
    * **Give example of at least four different entity security services and how they contribute to security prevention.**
    * **Give example of at least four different communication security services and how they contribute to security prevention.**
    * **Give example of at least four different application level security services and how they contribute to security prevention.**
    * **Give example of at least four security management services and how they contribute to security prevention.**
* **Draw a picture showing the relations between major different security services from a systems point of view.**
* **A logical security architecture can be created using a six steps methodology:**
    * **Describe each of the different steps**
    * **What is the end result?**
    * **Give an example of a logical security architecture**
* **What is a physical security architecture?**
* **A physical security architecture when using the SABSA include making a mapping to physical security mechanisms**
    * **Describe what is meant by a "Naming and registration" mechanism and give examples**
    * **Describe what is meant by a "Storage and runtime" mechanism and give examples**
    * **Describe what is meant by a "Physical security" mechanism and give examples**
    * **Describe what is meant by an "Authentication and session" protection mechanism and give examples**
    * **Describe what is meant by a "User interface and naming" mechanism and give examples**
    * **Describe what is meant by a "Authorization and access control" mechanism and give examples**
    * **Describe what is meant by a "Monitoring and incident" mechanism and give examples**
* **What must in addition to the security mechanisms be specified in the physical security architecture?**
* **Give example of platform security solution that can be used to build solutions meeting a logical security services and can be used to protect the chosen physical security * mechanism?**
* **For the SSO logical security architecture given at the lecture, perform the following:**
    * **Identify the main physical security mechanisms needed in the corresponding physical security architecture.**
    * **Identify the main platform security components needed to fulfil the architecture**
        * **Suggest concrete platform security mechanisms to use for the physical realization.**
