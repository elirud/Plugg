* __Describe what constitutes a security architecture and give some examples.__
* __The Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture (SABSA) consist of 5 layers and one cross layer.__
    * __Describe the different layer views and list the names of the different layers.__
    * __Give examples of questions the different SABSA architecture views are supposed to answer__
* __Which are the three different types of security services in a logical security architecture?__
    * __List and explain examples of services part of the non-prevention type of security services.__
* __Describe each of the different prevention security services in more details.__
    * __Give example of at least four different entity security services and how they contribute to security prevention.__
    * __Give example of at least four different communication security services and how they contribute to security prevention.__
    * __Give example of at least four different application level security services and how they contribute to security prevention.__
    * __Give example of at least four security management services and how they contribute to security prevention.__
* __Draw a picture showing the relations between major different security services from a systems point of view.__
* __A logical security architecture can be created using a six steps methodology:__
    * __Describe each of the different steps__
    * __What is the end result?__
    * __Give an example of a logical security architecture__
* __What is a physical security architecture?__
* __A physical security architecture when using the SABSA include making a mapping to physical security mechanisms__
    * __Describe what is meant by a "Naming and registration" mechanism and give examples__
    * __Describe what is meant by a "Storage and runtime" mechanism and give examples__
    * __Describe what is meant by a "Physical security" mechanism and give examples__
    * __Describe what is meant by an "Authentication and session" protection mechanism and give examples__
    * __Describe what is meant by a "User interface and naming" mechanism and give examples__
    * __Describe what is meant by a "Authorization and access control" mechanism and give examples__
    * __Describe what is meant by a "Monitoring and incident" mechanism and give examples__
* __What must in addition to the security mechanisms be specified in the physical security architecture?__
* __Give example of platform security solution that can be used to build solutions meeting a logical security services and can be used to protect the chosen physical security  mechanism?__
* __For the SSO logical security architecture given at the lecture, perform the following:__
    * __Identify the main physical security mechanisms needed in the corresponding physical security architecture.__
    * __Identify the main platform security components needed to fulfil the architecture__
        * __Suggest concrete platform security mechanisms to use for the physical realization.__
